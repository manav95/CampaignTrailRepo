War with Russia, stagflation, culture war, climate change, and drug overdoses are all making their mark on the country, and voters are fed up with the status quo. In a shocking turn of events, neither Trump nor Biden have secured their party's nomination. In their place are two passionate outsiders aiming to battle it out all the way for the White House. They will have to unite their parties or jettison the establishments entirely, prove their qualifications are sufficient or that their personas and visions for the country alone are sufficient, and fight each other negatively or more positively.

Kennedy Jr. is a scion of the Kennedy dynasty, a dynasty that has been prominent for decades in American politics. Son of the slain Robert Kennedy, RFK Jr has sought to continue his late father's crusade for justice and equality of opportunity. He has spent his career as an environmental lawyer, suing major corporations for pollution and environmental damage. He also has been an anti-vaccine crusader since 2005, which has alienated many of his friends and family. <br><br>He has also entertained various conspiracy theories surrounding the assassinations of his father and uncle, as well as the recent Covid pandemic. He also has a history of womanizing and drug addiction, with his second wife committing suicide due to the former. Additionally, he has spasmodic dysphonia that causes his voice to quaver and dramatically impacts his public speaking.<br><br>This should have made his candidacy dead on arrival, if not for the revelation of President Biden's dementia and related coverup. The ensuing backlash enabled Kennedy to sweep all states on Super Tuesday, and he was able to win the nomination with a supermajority of pledged delegates. The party establishment was not happy, and some are mulling a potential third-party run by current President Kamala Harris.<br><br>Kennedy is currently running neck and neck with Ramaswamy, and he will have to somehow unite a fractured party base while keeping the party establishment from backing Harris. Kennedy is an engaging, intelligent speaker in spite of his speech impediment, and he hopes to win with a centrist, pro-middle class, dovish platform.</div></div></div></div></div></div>","color_hex":"#0000ff","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://www.ans.org/file/11934/Kennedy,+Robert+F+Jr+5x7+2023.jpg","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>The Return of Camelot</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Defeated!</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>Better be on President Harris's Good Side</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":true}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":202,"fields":{"first_name":"Cornel","last_name":"West","election":20,"party":"Green Party","state":"Ohio","priority":1,"description":"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'> FOR DESCRIPTION ONLY: Cornel West is an academic and firebrand socialist running on the Green Party ticket.
